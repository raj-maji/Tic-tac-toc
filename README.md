# Tic-tac-toc

# This Java code implements a Tic-Tac-Toe game using Swing, with a GUI, game logic, and win conditions, allowing two players to take turns and displaying the winner. It includes features like random first turn, button disabling, and win checking, but has areas for improvement in string comparisons and win checking.
